# BeerHub
Android app for annoymous, fun, and less than secure self-tracking of office beer-fridge interactions.  The vision includes leaderboards and gamification-style badges.
### Device Description
Included in the root directory is the file 'RCA-7-voyager-II.xml'.  In android studio, under the AVD manager, click "Create Virtual Device", then "Import Hardware Profiles", in order to have it included in the list of available devices to choose from the first time you go to run/debug.
